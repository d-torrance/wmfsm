2002-07-13 02:43:28 GMT	Chris Gray <cgray4@po-box.mcgill.ca>	patch-1

    Summary:
      Implemented an [include] section.
    Revision:
      wmfsm--dev--0.3--patch-1

    As per user request, I added an [include] section to the ~/.wmfsmrc file
    so that you can explicitly include filesystems rather than just
    excluding them.

    Also made a new SGML manpage because *roff sucks.

    Summary:
      First arch commit.
    Revision:
      wmfsm--dev--0.3--base-0

    wmfsm is a fairly complete program, but it's still nice to have some
    version control.

	* configure.in: Did a lot of work so that maintenance should be
	easier in the future.  Things are totally done with
	automake/autoconf now.  The goal is to remove all of the OS
	dependent ifdefs and change them to depend on the actual feature
	of the OS that we are testing for.

	* debian/wmfsm.1: Changed the man page to reflect the new
	options.  I should probably distribute this man page in such a way
	that non-Debian users can install it easily.

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Added getopt support, and a new option, --delay.
	The delay should be 10 * number in microseconds which seems a bit
	unintuitive to me.  I'll probably change that.

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Added FreeBSD patches from Steven Enderle
	<panic@subphase.de>.  Also, it looks like I am taking this project
	over.  Hopefully I can do some good!
