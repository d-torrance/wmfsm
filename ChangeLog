2015-01-21  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* ChangeLog, ChangeLog.old: Combine ChangeLog and
	ChangeLog.old.

	As ChangeLog is no longer automatically generated by arch, there is
	no need to keep these files separate.

2015-01-21  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Impove version number handling.

	In particular,
	- Add new --version command line option.  (This was already
	  documented in the manpage.)  Remove this information from the --help
	  text.  Also took the opportunity to properly align the --fire line
	  in the --help text.
	- Remove WMFSM_VERSION macro in favor of PACKAGE_VERSION from
	  autconf.
	- Remove hard-coded version number at top of source file for
	  maintainability.

	* AUTHORS, configure.ac: Update with new contact information.

2015-01-21  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* wmfsm/Makefile.am, wmfsm/wmfsm.1, wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Add -a
	command line option to select appearance at runtime.

	Also update Makefile to install appearance XPMs during "make
	install".

2015-01-21  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* configure.ac, wmfsm/Makefile.am, wmfsm/wmfsm_master.xpm: wmfsm:
	Add --with-xpm option to configure to select appearance at compile
	time.

	Note that wmfsm/wmfsm_master.xpm has been removed, as it is now
	created as a symlink during configure.  It is also removed by "make
	clean".

2015-01-21  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* TODO: Remove TODO; all the items have been done.

2015-01-21  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	In particular, if fscanf does not read the expected number of items
	from /etc/mtab, print a warning message.

2015-01-20  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* COPYING: Update COPYING from
	http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.txt.

2015-01-20  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	In particular,
	- Apply, with some modification, a patch by Jari Aalto
	  <jari.aalto@poboxes.com> to clarify the format of the
	  configuration file.  See [1].
	- Escape minus signs to avoid hyphen-used-as-minus-sign Lintian
	  warning in the Debian package.
	- Remove docbook-to-man comments to avoid
	  manpage-has-errors-from-man Lintian warning in the Debian package.

2015-01-19  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Apply further Debian patches.

	The individual patches no longer seem to exist, so I submit them
	together.  According to debian/changelog entries by Arthur Korn
	<arthur@debian.org>, these patches include:
	* fixed memleak introduced in 0.34-2 with the patch by Timo Benk.
	  global char *mp[] was assigned the result of stdup() repeatedly
	  without free. My ugly fix is to free it all up at the beginning of
	  readFileSystems(). Now I'm a proud Perl coder ... closes: #196057
	* memleak news: avoid it if there are more than 9 filesystems too.
	* Fixed filesystem name corruption, thanks to Ralf Horstmann and
	  Cristian Ionescu-Idbohrn for the patch.

2015-01-19  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Read newly mounted filesystems.

	Patch by Timo Benk <t_benk@web.de> to fix Debian bug #186826 [1].

2015-01-19  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* configure.ac: Autotools updates.

	In particular,
	- Update AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE to silence "two- and three-arguments forms
	  are deprecated" warnings.
	- Update AC_DEFINEs to silence "missing template" warnings.

2015-01-19  Doug Torrance <dtorrance@monmouthcollege.edu>

	* configure.ac, configure.in: Rename configure.in to

    Summary:
      Implemented an [include] section.
    Revision:
      wmfsm--dev--0.3--patch-1

    As per user request, I added an [include] section to the ~/.wmfsmrc file
    so that you can explicitly include filesystems rather than just
    excluding them.

    Also made a new SGML manpage because *roff sucks.

2001-01-19  Chris Gray  <cgray@tribsoft.com>

	* configure.in: Did a lot of work so that maintenance should be
	easier in the future.  Things are totally done with
	automake/autoconf now.  The goal is to remove all of the OS
	dependent ifdefs and change them to depend on the actual feature
	of the OS that we are testing for.

2001-01-13  Chris Gray  <cgray@tribsoft.com>

	* debian/wmfsm.1: Changed the man page to reflect the new
	options.  I should probably distribute this man page in such a way
	that non-Debian users can install it easily.

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Added getopt support, and a new option, --delay.
	The delay should be 10 * number in microseconds which seems a bit
	unintuitive to me.  I'll probably change that.

2001-01-09  Chris Gray  <cgray@tribsoft.com>

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Added FreeBSD patches from Steven Enderle
	<panic@subphase.de>.  Also, it looks like I am taking this project
	over.  Hopefully I can do some good!

0.30    24/08/1999  OpenBSD support, it hopefully works...
                    Blinking on a filesystem that is 95 percent full
0.30    04/06/1999  use fstat() instead of system("df")
                    Exclusion of directories via ~/.wmfsmrc
                    uses less colors (54), other colorschemes are included
0.27    26/03/1999  mouse toggable fire/normal mode
                    bug fixes
                    Solaris 2.6/7 support
0.26    06/03/1999  added fire mode for bars
0.25	05/03/1999	first release
