	* configure.in: Did a lot of work so that maintenance should be
	easier in the future.  Things are totally done with
	automake/autoconf now.  The goal is to remove all of the OS
	dependent ifdefs and change them to depend on the actual feature
	of the OS that we are testing for.

	* debian/wmfsm.1: Changed the man page to reflect the new
	options.  I should probably distribute this man page in such a way
	that non-Debian users can install it easily.

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Added getopt support, and a new option, --delay.
	The delay should be 10 * number in microseconds which seems a bit
	unintuitive to me.  I'll probably change that.

	* wmfsm/wmfsm.c: Added FreeBSD patches from Steven Enderle
	<panic@subphase.de>.  Also, it looks like I am taking this project
	over.  Hopefully I can do some good!
